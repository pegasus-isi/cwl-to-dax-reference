- the cwl-util parser needs to be maintained if we rely on it
    - the good thing here is that it seems to be auto-generated code based on a schema
        so that may not be an issue as the schema gets updated 

- commands:
    cwltool --pack source.cwl > packed-source.cwl
        - this will combine files into a single one where source is the workflow
        - note that this turns the yaml format into a JSON one 

    cwltool --print-dot source.cwl | dot -Tsvg > source.svg
        - generate svg of workflow
    
    cwltool --validate source.cwl
        - validate the workflow 

Overview of the DAX XML Schema
------------------------------
- initial input files and their PFNS needs to be placed in a separate YAML file,
    and so this needs to be parsed by the converter script 

- DAX has Invoke, CWL does not
    - that is CWL does not have a field where we can specify that a submit host
        executes "what" (some executable), "when" some event happens such as 
        "on_exit", "on_err", "start", etc..
