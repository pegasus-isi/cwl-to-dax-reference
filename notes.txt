- the cwl-util parser needs to be maintained if we rely on it
    - the good thing here is that it seems to be auto-generated code based on a schema
        so that may not be an issue as the schema gets updated 

Overview of the DAX XML Schema
------------------------------
- DAX has Invoke, CWL does not
    - that is CWL does not have a field where we can specify that a submit host
        executes "what" (some executable), "when" some event happens such as 
        "on_exit", "on_err", "start", etc..
